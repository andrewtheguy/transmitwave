- use project's ./tmp/ directory (not /tmp) for test files
- dont add too much doccs to save output tokens
- I'll run my vite http server, don't try to start another server
- run integration tests in release mode for performance
- use gtimeout command instead of timeout on macOS systems
- build WASM with standard `wasm-pack build --release --target web` (env imports handled via wasm-env-shim.js workaround)
